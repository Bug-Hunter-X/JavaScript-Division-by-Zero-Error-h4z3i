# JavaScript Division by Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: division by zero.  The `divide` function is designed to handle this specific error case by throwing an error if the divisor is zero.  However, it's important to note that more robust error handling might be needed in production environments to manage other potential issues, such as non-numeric input.

## Bug Description
The `divide` function correctly handles division by zero by throwing an error. However, more comprehensive error handling could be added to address potential scenarios like non-numeric input, which would lead to unexpected results or errors.
